"""The leak check in conftest.py is only worth having if it actually fires.

Everything else in this suite is protected by the guard; the guard itself
is protected by nothing, and deleting it would go green. So this runs the
*real* `tests/conftest.py` -- copied, not reimplemented -- over a throwaway
test that leaks a thread on purpose, in a subprocess, and asserts the run
comes back red.

Copied rather than rewritten deliberately. A guard reimplemented beside
its test is the failure `nova_replies.run_once` was split out to fix: the
test drove a copy of the body written next to it and passed under a
mutation that broke the real thing.
