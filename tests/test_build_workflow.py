"""The build workflow must serialise pipelines per branch.

`update-manifest` in build.yaml is a blind `sed` of whichever image digest
its own run produced, so two pipelines running in parallel deploy whichever
one *finished last*, which is not the same as whichever commit is newest.

Measured 2026-08-12 in agora-claude-bridge, whose copy of build.yaml is
identical: its #41 and #40 merged four seconds apart, #40 was the newer
commit, and #41's build pushed its digest one second later and overwrote it
-- pinning that repo's config to the commit before the endpoint #40 had just
added. Both CI runs were green, the image built, ArgoCD synced, and the
deployed pod served a 404 for a feature that was merged in main. This repo
merges just as many PRs per cycle and has the same race; it has only been
lucky with timing.

Scope, stated precisely because the first draft of this docstring overclaimed
and a reviewer caught it: build.yaml is seeded by the Crossplane Composition
(githubservice-composition.yaml) with managementPolicies [Observe, Create,
LateInitialize], so Crossplane never overwrites this repo's hand-edited copy.
These tests guard *this repo only*. They are not seeded by the template --
the template ships a Node/vitest starter and its build.yaml runs `npm test`,
so a freshly created service would never run this file. The template got the
same concurrency block committed to it separately; nothing automatically
checks the two against each other.
