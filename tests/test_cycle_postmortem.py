"""Why an entryless cycle ended (idea #159).

The whole tool rests on reading one free-text line Agora writes, so most
of what is pinned here is that the two outcomes it distinguishes really
are distinguished, and that a line it does not recognise is a finding
rather than a shrug.

Every fixture string below is a verbatim closing line taken off a real
conversation on 2026-08-29, not one invented to match the regex.
