"""The build is skipped only when the image provably cannot have changed.

`.github/image-paths.py` decides, before `build-push` starts, whether the diff
a push carries can have changed the image. Getting that wrong in one direction
costs a wasted four-minute build; getting it wrong in the other means a real
change never deploys and every check stays green. So the tests here are almost
all about the second direction.

The pinned list in `test_the_watched_paths_are_exactly_these` is a deliberate
change-detector and the only one in this file. It is what makes a new `COPY`
in the Dockerfile a red test rather than a silently unwatched path: the module
derives its answer from the Dockerfile, and this asserts that what it derives
today is still what somebody read and agreed to.
